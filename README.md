### Aim and Objective
We aim to replace metallic keys by building a fully featured password enabled electronic security system prototype. One could attest to the fact that the metallic keys used to access mechanical door locks are very susceptible to getting lost, which would mean breaking the locks over and over again if there are more occurrences of such scenarios, moreover, such access keys can be duplicated by unauthorized users. Using an electronic door lock would counteract the damning consequences of such repugnant occurrences.

### Introduction
Security is a prime concern in our day-to-day life. Everyone wants to be as secure as possible. Our doors serve as entrances to our homes and offices. They may also provide access to strangers, criminals and offenders. An access control for doors forms a vital link in a security chain. This is the sole purpose of door locks. The standard type of doorknob is easy to manipulate and provides weak protection. This is the prime objective to move from conventional locks to digital locks. The objective of this project in its simplest terms is to replace metallic keys by building a fully featured password enabled electronic security system prototype. Below are steps taken to achieve this purpose:
- Review of similar works on electronic door access key was carried out.
- Determination/Selection of materials relevant to the project.
- Hardware and Software design.
- Construction/Packaging of the various components of the system.Testing of the final project to ascertain its authenticity.
